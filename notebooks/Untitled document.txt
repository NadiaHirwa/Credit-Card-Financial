Task Description:
Using the data provided on the Looker Studio assignment (maintaining the existing groups you were assigned), and building on the project structuring and documentation exercises completed this week, you are required to:
1. Develop a well-formatted, self-contained HTML report that includes:
   * Descriptive analysis with clear, insightful explanations.
   * Meaningful visualizations accompanied by thoughtful interpretations.
   * Data-driven recommendations supported by appropriate statistical tests.
   * Comments on possible correlations between variables where applicable.
2. Create a presentation of your insights, preferably using Quarto, or any other suitable tool. Your slides should effectively summarize the key findings and recommendations from your analysis.
Submission Instructions:
* Only one group member should submit the two final files (the HTML report and the presentation slides) via Google Classroom.
* However, each individual group member must push their own well-structured and fully documented version of the project to their personal GitHub repository.
File Naming:
Both the HTML report and the presentation slides should be clearly named according to your dataset’s name.
Example: If your dataset is named “Crime Against Woman”, your files should be
* crimes_against_women_data_analysis_report.html
* crimes_against_women_data_insights_slides.pdf or crimes_against_women_data_insights_slides.pptx or crimes_against_women_data_insights_slides.html
