        "\n",
        "We see that annual fees range from $95 to $500, with a mean of $291.85 and a median of $295. The distribution appears approximately symmetrical, centered around common fee brackets, suggesting a standardized pricing structure across products. The upper range could reflect premium services or high-tier customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The activation within 30 days is a binary variable, and the mean of 0.57 indicates that about 57% of customers activated their accounts promptly. This majority suggests either strong onboarding or incentives driving early engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customer acquisition costs range from $40 to $172, with an average of $96.25. While the median is close to the mean at $95, the standard deviation of $25.77 suggests moderate variation in marketing or sales strategies. The higher end may reflect targeted campaigns for premium customer segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "All records come from the year 2023, ensuring temporal consistency and simplifying trend comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "The credit limit distribution is notably right-skewed. Limits range from $1,438 to $34,516, with a mean of $8,635 and a median of $4,549. This substantial gap implies that while most customers have modest limits, a small segment enjoys significantly higher lines of credit, potentially due to higher incomes or credit scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Total revolving balances and utilization ratios also exhibit right-skewness. The average revolving balance is $1,162.79, and the average utilization is 27.5%, though a portion of customers reach full utilization (max = 99.9%). This pattern is typical in credit datasets, where most users maintain moderate usage, but some hover near or at the limit, signaling financial stress or high spending behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Total transaction amounts average $4,404.63, with a wide spread (up to $18,484), indicating variability in spending patterns. Transaction volumes range from 10 to 139, with a median of 67, aligning with moderate monthly use and consistent card engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interest earned also reveals financial diversity. The average is $775.96, but values go up to $4,785, implying some customers are carrying balances over time, while others pay off promptly and avoid interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "The delinquency rate is low, with only about 6% of customers having a delinquent account. This suggests relatively healthy repayment behavior in the majority of the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customers report an average of 2.35 dependents, ranging up to 5, with the most common values between 1 and 3. This distribution supports a demographic base consisting of family households.\n",
        "\n",
        "Income is perhaps the most skewed feature. It spans from $1,250 to $239,791, with a mean of $56,976 and median near $44,768. This implies income inequality in the sample, with a small number of high earners pulling up the average. The majority earn below $76K, with a significant concentration in the lower brackets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, customer satisfaction scores range from 1 (low) to 5 (high), with an average of 3.19. This moderate central tendency suggests generally neutral-to-positive feedback, but with room for improvement. The distribution’s standard deviation of 1.26 shows variation in experience across customer segments.\n",

Surprisingly, individuals with an \"Unknown\" education level report the highest average income (16.99%), followed by \" Uneducated\" graduates (16.79%). Meanwhile, those with \"Doctorate\" degrees have the lowest average income (16.27%). This suggests that formal education does not necessarily correlate with higher income in this dataset, possibly due to other factors like occupation type or regional economic conditions.\n",
